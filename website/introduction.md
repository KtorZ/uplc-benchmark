# Introduction

Cardano smart-contract language ecosystem develops rapidly and offers many languages without a single and comprehensive performance comparison.
The purpose of Cardano onchain language benchmark project is to implement the same suite of Cardano onchain validators in multiple languages compiled to UPLC, develop a language-agnostic test suite to test the equivalence of validators, and measure the performance of each language looking at script size and execution units.

Specifications of validators that are to be implemented in each language are available [here](specifications.md).

Benchmark results, when available, will be published on this website.

Everything, including specifications and this website is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/uplc-benchmark).
